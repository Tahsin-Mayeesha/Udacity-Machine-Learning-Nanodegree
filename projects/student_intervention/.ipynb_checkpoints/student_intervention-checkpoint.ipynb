In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The three supervised learning models that I've chosen are :\n",
    "1. Decision Trees\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "3. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Decision Trees** : \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are widely used in several industries including medicine(to classify diseases based on patient's features for example), biomedical research, financial analysis(fraud detection,credit defaulting etc) for both classification and regression problem, astronomy to social media websites for predicting engagement/ad clicks for it's interpretability and versatality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strengths : \n",
    "    1. Decision Trees are interpretable and easy to visualize.\n",
    "    2. Decision Trees can handle both categorical and numerical data\n",
    "    3. All else being equal, decision trees prefer shorter trees to longer trees by splitting on the \"best features\"(using information gain or gini impurity index), so it's easy to understand what are the most important features in a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weeknesses :\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Decision trees grow exponentially with the number of features\n",
    "    2. Decision trees overfit very easily as it picks up subtle variances in the data set. However, over-fitting can be minimized by calculating best maximum depth of the tree, minimum number of samples to spilt per node and pruning techniques after creating the tree. Random forest, another model based on decision trees are incredibly popular as it minimizes errors by ensembling over many decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reasons for choosing this model : \n",
    "    1. This dataset has many features and a problem like predicting which students need intervention is unlikely to be  linear relationship completely as many details influence a student's learning.\n",
    "    2. Most features in this data set are binary which is for a decision tree to handle with conditionals and the resulting tree will be easier to interpret and thus determine a course of action to ensure student's learning rate improves.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "** 2. Support Vector Machine :** \n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines classify data by finding the maximum margin hyperplane that seperates class labels, it's also a very popular model like the other two, decision trees and K-nearest neighbors and used in industry for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strengths  :\n",
    "    1. As Support Vector Machine tries to find the seperator hyperplane that has the maximum distance between the seperate classes, it's not prone to overfitting.\n",
    "    2. Linear SVM produces a line as decision boundary, but SVM is also effetive with high dimensional data by using Kernel-trick (mapping the data points to higher dimensional spaces to find the appropriate class labels) \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Weeknesses :\n",
    "    1. Performance depends on the choice of Kernel. Large data sets may take a lot of time to train.\n",
    "    2. SVM works really well for datasets that has a clear margin of seperation, but performs poorly on noisy datasets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Reasons for choosing this model :\n",
    "    1. As there are many features in this dataset, if this datset has a good margin of seperation SVM would be able to pick it up. \n",
    "    2. SVM also works well with high dimensional data with kernel trick, and this dataset has many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. K Nearest Neighbor ** :\n",
    "\n",
    "K nearest neighbor is a method of 'instance based learning'/lazy learning as the computation begins when we start predicting, it's also a non-parametric method. K nearest neighbor tries to find similar instances for each query and predicts based on their average/majority voting for classification and regression problem. It can be used in many different cases including content retrieval for photos, videos, text and recommending products etc. It's one of the most popular methods in data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strengths :\n",
    "    1. It does not make any assumptions about the distribution of data. Rather it simply tries to find the most similar k neighbors for each query based on some distance metric/similarity measurement and uses the whole data set for each query.\n",
    "    2. After choosing the number of neighbors k and the similarity metric d , the algorithm is simple to implement in production.\n",
    "    3. It's possible to weight the contribution of the neighbors for predicting labels (weighting the nearest neighbors highest and the distant one's lower) for higher accuracy. For datasets that don't follow a general pattern, K nearest neighbor is often a really good choice.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Weeknesses: \n",
    "    1. K-nearest neighbor requires the entire dataset to be preserved in the memory. Unlike a parametric model like linear regression where we just have to train once to find the parameters, we can't throw away the data set and this can make the space requirement incredibly high.\n",
    "    2. It's important to use domain knowledge and grid search techniques to find a good similarity measure and a good k, in practice there can be many variations of distance metrics which can yield different performances.\n",
    "    3. It's less interpretable than models like decision tree where we can understand which features are the strongest.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Reasons for choosing this model:\n",
    "    1. Students who are failing may have similar patterns such as similar amount of time invested in recreation over studying, similar number of family members and income, similar geographic region etc which K nearest neighbor can deal with easily.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reasons : \n",
    "    1. DecisionTreeClassifier shows clear signs of overfitting. It fits the training data perfectly with a F1-score of 1, but performs worse on the testing data compared to both SVM and k-nearest neighbor. So Decision Tree would clearly not be an appropriate model for this data set.\n",
    "    2. K-Nearest Neighbor actually shows quite stable performance over training and testing data sets and performs better both on the training and testing data sets steadily as the score increased with more training data(possibly because it found similar students with more training instances for the query instances). However, K-nearest's performance on the test data set is still poor compared to SVM.\n",
    "    3. SVM's average test score is 0.7726, beating both decision tree(average f1 on test set = 0.7080) and k-nearest neighbor(average f1 score 0.7223), based on scores SVM is the best choice. It's true that there's subtle differences of computation time for training and testing phases but for a small data set like this the differences are not that important."

    "The model that was chosen is called Support Vector Machine which is a linear seperator. Intuitively in the simplest case, we can imagine a 2D plane where we plot the data and labels on the x and y axis respective and we want to seperate the labels using a line. We can choose many lines for this task, assuming the labels are not overlapping, however, support vector machine will choose the \"maximum margine\" line, the line that has the biggest distance from the nearest points of both classes, i.e the line which is actually in the 'middle'. We choose this line to generalize the model to test data and avoid overfitting, a line too close to either of the classes can misclassify quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the higher dimension data sets instead of a line we map the datapoints to higher dimensions(with 'kernel trick') and find the maximum margin hyperplane to seperate the classes with as much gap as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "For practical purposes, choosing decision tree would have been more interpretable, but in this case would have led to overfitting (as we have seen in the table) and intervention of a student who's actually doing well because of a bad model would have led to negative consequences in this student's life. Choosing something like K-Nearest perhaps would have been stable perhaps, but not as interpretable as decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Support vector machine's clearly showed best performance so far and it's an widely used algorithm in the industry too, so SVM was chosen. Visualizing SVM is not as easy as decision tree's, but it has better performance."

The most probable reason behind this situation is probably that grid search ended up choosing the default parameters despite given more options. I tried to reduce the C parameter, but it chose the value 1 again, which is also the default value, despite given more options for the Kernel it again chose the default version, which is \"rbf\" for non-linear datasets which is also optimum. The number of training points also don't vary as the total number of training points are 300. \n",
